php-gitlab-api
==============

Based on [php-github-api](https://github.com/m4tthumphrey/php-github-api) and code from [KnpLabs](https://github.com/KnpLabs/php-github-api).

Note that this is used in a production envrionment which uses my fork of [gitlabhq](https://github.com/m4tthumphrey/gitlabhq). There are some slight changes from the original GitLab including the ability to protect and unprotect branches via the API and the ability to set the namespace ID when creating new projects.
